# myemacs


My emacs configuration, as filled with useful settings found around the interwebs. Makes use of Powerline for status bar, Company and Flywheel for syntax checking, autocompletion etc.

Edit the name and email address for Git on lines 1 and 2, and save as ~/.emacs (or ~/.emacs.d/init.el) and should be good to go :)
